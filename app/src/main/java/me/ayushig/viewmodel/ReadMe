This project intents to fetch the popular movie json from
"https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies"
and render them into a grid format which is a designed layout in recycler view.

Upon clicking on the object it takes the user into very simple detail page as of now, which
can be extended to do multiple actions.

App uses Room DB for Offline Loading, Daager for dependency injection.
It is implemented in MVVM architecture and uses shared view model approach
for communication between two fragments.

currently app has test cases for data base and movies list view model.
